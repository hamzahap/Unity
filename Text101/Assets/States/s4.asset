  storyText: "Well, all three of us made this and brought it to where we are now.\r\nYep,
    fucking nowhere!\r\nAlthough Melvic Mare is the \"Real Mare\" as we know him.\r\nBut
    that \"Mare\" word is a fucking disease. It spreads and look \r\nhow much it
    has spread. It sounds stupid yet people use it. Why?\r\nWHYYYYYYYY!!!\r\nWell....Nobody
    knows.....\r\nMaybe its a meme, Maybe its an obsession,Maybe it is something
    that will haunt us till we  stay in the group.\r\nWho knows? NOBODY!\r\nIt was
    all fun and games when it was casual. It feels like a chant,\r\nsomething that
    takes over you without you realizing.\r\nI can go longer about this but do you
    wanna?\r\n\r\n1. Yea\r\n2. Nah, it's fucking boring"
